                Pueblo Revolt. After many years are hostility towards Spanish
                oppression of indigenous in New Mexico, and the introduction of
                European diseases which killed off many natives, a revolt was
                orchestrated by Popé (or Po-pay), a religious leader from one of
                the New Mexico pueblos. They successfully drove the Spaniards
                from all but Southern, New Mexico. This left the Natives in
                control of New Mexico. Unfortunately, in 1692, Spanish forces
                once again took the capital, offering clemency to Natives who
                swore allegiance to the King of Spain.

                time, trade along the Santa Fe trail was opened which opened

                New Mexico is the 5th largest State by area but is one of the
                least populated, ranking number 36th. It is a very diverse State
                which has the highest population of Hispanic and Latino
                Americans and the 2nd highest percentage of Native Americans.
                The landscape is as diverse as its people, with forested
                mountains to deserts. You can enjoy skiing and winter sports in
                the north and east and much warmer and arid climates in the
                south and west. There are 3 UNESCO World Heritage Sites, which
                is more than any other state. It is truly the Land of
                Enchantment.
