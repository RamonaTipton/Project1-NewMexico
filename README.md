# New Mexico, Where in the World?

I have lived in the UK since 2007 and until I left, I never really appreciated my home state, New Mexico, until I went back to visit. Suddenly everything that I took for granted during my life there made me realise what an incredibly beautiful and unique place it is. It's one of those places that is so amazing, you want to show _everyone_.

This site represents my passion for New Mexico but is also my showcase for those who want to learn more about it. It includes both the history and places that make New Mexico unlike any on earth. This site has been designed to inform and inspire. It is bigger than scope suggests but my confidence in HTML and CSS really transformed with this site.

## Technologies Used

HTML, CSS

## Features

### User Experience (UX)

The aim of this site is for users of all ages to get information about New Mexico and including places, sites and events in a clear, concise and structured format which is easy to navigate on all screen sizes and is accessible.

### Site Features

- #### Navigation Bar

  - Features bespoke logo created using Adobe AI. This is consistent on all screen sizes.
  - Navigation is responsive with hamburger used on mobile devices and not on larger screens making navigation easy.

- #### The Landing Page

  - Photo was chosen as it has depth allowing the user to see far into it on all screen sizes. This was chosen to caputure the eye and entice the user in further.

  - "Discovery" section highlights what the user can expect to find on the webisite with quick links to the other pages with the boxes which will allow continued interaction without looking for the navigation bar. This section is designed to hook the user to delve furthr into the site.

  - Contact section is located above the footer on all pages and is linked directly in the navigation bar. This allows the user to be able to get information without deviating to a new page.

- #### History Page

  - Timeline structure used to break up large chunks of information while stil giving a usable feel. The timeline is vertical which is beneficial to mobile users to enable scroll.

  - Information has been collated and annoted to give a lot of information in small snippets. This allows the reader to continue reading without becoming bored or overwhelmed with too much information.

  - The design is basic as to not take away from the information being portrayed.

  ##### Features not implemented

  I would have liked to provide more information or an "at a glance" section for some of the main facts of New Mexico. I would also like to have provided a "did you know" section to highlight fun information that may appeal more to the user.

- #### Visiting Page

  - Broken down into 3 sections (places, sites & events), this page is designed to give the user a flavor of each section.

  - Places include a "Things to Do" section and all sections include a link to the external website to allow the user to find out more with ease.

  - Events section provides the time of the year for the event to allow travel planning at a glance.

  - Photos have been chosen to draw the user in and have been optimised to allow for good resolution at all screen sizes.

  - The use of flexbox allows for responsive flow for each place box on all screen sizes.
