            <br>
            <p>While cities in New Mexico aren't on the scale of other states, what they lack in cosmopolitan flare they make up for in a diverse offering of cuisine, nightlife and daytime activities both in and around. Here are some top destinations.</p>

              <br />
              <p>
                Albuquerque is New Mexico’s largest city and, like most cities,
                has a vibrant nightlife but is also packed with historic places and fun
                things to do, whether travelling solo or with family and/or
                friends. If you get tired of the city life, travelling less than
                an hour will get you back to nature in the Sandia Mountains to
                the east or the Rio Grande bosque which runs through the middle
                of the city.

              <p>
                Santa Fe is the capital of New Mexico and the oldest state capital. Sitting at over 7000ft (2100m) above sea-level, it
                is also the highest. It is a melting pot of culture and history aptly nicknamed ‘The City Different’. Considered one of
                the greatest art cities in the USA, Santa Fe is an art lover’s paradise. Visiting one of its many markets or enjoying
                some of the best restaurants in New Mexico is something every traveller should do.

              <p>
                If you are looking for the bustle and excitement of a big city, Taos is not the place to be. Taos is a place of
                tranquillity, art, nature and culture. Located in the Sangre de Cristo mountains, Taos has an energy unlike any other
                place. You can get a drink and listen to live music in the town’s plaza in the summer or hit the slopes at Taos Ski
                Valley in the winter. If that doesn’t interest you, then rafting in the Rio Grande may be the way to go.

                Situated in southern New Mexico, Las Cruces is closer to Mexico than to Albuquerque. This is the second largest of New
                Mexico’s cities and is enjoyed by visitors and residents for its temperate climate year-round and over 350 days of
                clear, blue skies. With the Organ mountains to the east, visitors can enjoy a day of hiking before heading into the city
                for some good food and New Mexican wine.

              <p>
                Roswell is primarily known for the UFO incident in 1947 where some believe the crash was an alien spaceship which is
                being covered up by the military. Others, however, believe that the crash was just debris from a military balloon.
                Whatever your belief, Roswell offers much more than aliens and spaceships. Located in the High Great Plains of
                southeastern New Mexico, there are many beautiful state parks nearby to ponder such historic mysteries.

              <p>
                You may have guessed from its name, Silver City was once a mining boom town in the 1800s. Battles with the nearby Apache
                Indians and with troublemakers like Billy the Kid made Silver City a lawless place and truly the wild west. Today,
                Silver City is a sleepy town with a population under 10,000. Located in southwestern New Mexico, it hosts many music and
                art festivals. A short journey away from Silver City you will find the Gila Cliff Dwellings National Monument and
                several lakes.

                Discovered in 1898 by a teenager, Carlsbad Caverns attracts thousands of visitors each year. Located in the Chihuahuan
                Desert of southern New Mexico, it has over 100 caves featuring large calcite deposits called stalactites and stalagmites
                which formed over hundreds of thousands of years. The largest is a chamber called the Big Room which is almost 4000ft
                (1220m) long and 625ft (191m) wide which makes it one of the largest in the world. It was granted UNESCO World Heritage
                status in 1995.

                The archaeological preservation and wonder of Gila Cliff Dwellings National Monument give tourists a glimpse into New
                Mexico history. Although evidence suggests that Pueblo people inhabited the caves from 900 to 1150AD, the dwellings were
                built by the Mogollon people between 1270 and 1300. The dwellings were built in five caves with up to 40 rooms per
                dwelling housing 10 to 15 families. Today, due to the preservation proclamation in 1907, 40% of the walls retain the
                original mortar.

              <p>
                Located in northwestern New Mexico, Chaco Canyon was given UNESCO World Heritage status in 1987 due to it being a major
                centre of Pueblo culture for over 2000 years and are today considered sacred by Hopi and Pueblo people. The
                scale of the ruins suggests an advanced engineering ability not seen anywhere else. It is said that for thousands of
                Ancestral Puebloans Chaco Canyon was used for ceremonial and pollical activities and trade between 850 and 1250AD.

                Stories of the wild west permeated the world and are the basis for Western movies and some of the most famous Hollywood
                movie stars like John Wayne and Clint Eastwood. Lincoln, New Mexico is one of the places you can still see what the west
                was like when it was wild with original buildings preserved and turned into museums. Here you will find the Lincoln
                County Courthouse where Billy the Kid escaped from the jail, killing Deputy James Bell. The preserved bullet hole can be
                seen today.

                To the west of Albuquerque is Petroglyph National Monument which has over 24,000 petroglyph carvings by Ancestral
                Puebloans. Some date as far back as 3000 years ago, although 90% are estimated to have been created between 1300 and
                1700AD. It is one of the largest petroglyph sites in North America. The monument lies on a chain of dormant volcanoes
                and there are several trails to allow visitors to see the petroglyphs and nature that surrounds them.

                When people think of wine, they probably don’t think of New Mexico. The first wine grapes were planted in 1629 by a
                Franciscan friar in the middle Rio Grande valley. Today there are more than 60 wineries which produce over 3.4 million
                litres of wine a year. The New Mexico Wine Festival celebrates New Mexican wine each spring over 3 days celebrating wine
                with music, art and other activities.

                Red, green or Christmas is the most asked question in New Mexico for the preference of the state’s prized Hatch chiles.
                They come in many forms making up New Mexican cuisine. Hatch Valley in the south is where much of the chile crop is
                grown. Each autumn when the chile is harvested, the smell of the roasting peppers fills the air. Each Labour Day
                weekend, you can gather in Hatch for the annual festival celebrating New Mexico’s famous chile.
