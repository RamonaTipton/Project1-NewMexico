              <br />
              <p>
                Albuquerque is New Mexico’s largest city and, like most cities,
                has a vibrant nightlife but is also packed with historic places and fun
                things to do, whether travelling solo or with family and/or
                friends. If you get tired of the city life, travelling less than
                an hour will get you back to nature in the Sandia Mountains to
                the east or the Rio Grande bosque which runs through the middle
                of the city.

              <br />
              <p>
                Santa Fe is the capital of New Mexico and the oldest state capital. Sitting at over 7000ft (2100m) above sea-level, it
                is also the highest. It is a melting pot of culture and history aptly nicknamed ‘The City Different’. Considered one of
                the greatest art cities in the USA, Santa Fe is an art lover’s paradise. Visiting one of its many markets or enjoying
                some of the best restaurants in New Mexico is something every traveller should do.

              <p>
                If you are looking for the bustle and excitement of a big city, Taos is not the place to be. Taos is a place of
                tranquillity, art, nature and culture. Located in the Sangre de Cristo mountains, Taos has an energy unlike any other
                place. You can get a drink and listen to live music in the town’s plaza in the summer or hit the slopes at Taos Ski
                Valley in the winter. If that doesn’t interest you, then rafting in the Rio Grande may be the way to go.

              <p>
                Situated in southern New Mexico, Las Cruces is closer to Mexico than to Albuquerque. This is the second largest of New
                Mexico’s cities and is enjoyed by visitors and residents for its temperate climate year-round and over 350 days of
                clear, blue skies. With the Organ mountains to the east, visitors can enjoy a day of hiking before heading into the city
                for some good food and New Mexican wine.

              <br />
              <p>
                Roswell is primarily known for the UFO incident in 1947 where some believe the crash was an alien spaceship which is
                being covered up by the military. Others, however, believe that the crash was just debris from a military balloon.
                Whatever your belief, Roswell offers much more than aliens and spaceships. Located in the High Great Plains of
                southeastern New Mexico, there are many beautiful state parks nearby to ponder such historic mysteries.

              <br />
              <p>
                You may have guessed from its name, Silver City was once a mining boom town in the 1800s. Battles with the nearby Apache
                Indians and with troublemakers like Billy the Kid made Silver City a lawless place and truly the wild west. Today,
                Silver City is a sleepy town with a population under 10,000. Located in southwestern New Mexico, it hosts many music and
                art festivals. A short journey away from Silver City you will find the Gila Cliff Dwellings National Monument and
                several lakes.
